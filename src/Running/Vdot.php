/**
 * Compute VDOT from a PR-race time (Daniels/Gilbert)
 *
 * Takes your <u>current</u> best measured performance at a given distance and
 * assigns an "effecive VO2 max"-score (VDOT) to it.
 *
 * VDOT stands for V-dot-O2-max. VDOT is not the VO2max that would be measured in the
 * laboratory. VDOT is mathematically generated based on performance. It not only
 * includes the VO2max as would be measured in the laboratory, but also the lactate-response
 * (threshold trigger point), running economy, running efficiency, biomechanics, and mental
 * toughness that also affects a runner's performance. Your actual race or PR time reflects
 * that composite (Daniels' Running Formula, pp. 58-60).
 *
 * You can plug in PR times for distances as low as 0.8 kilometers (800 meters) to as high as 50 kilometers.
